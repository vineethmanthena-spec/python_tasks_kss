#1. Fruit Sales Comparison (Series Addition) A shop tracks fruit sales:
#S1 = pd.Series([10, 20, 30], index=["apple", "banana", "cherry"])
#S2 = pd.Series([5, 15, 25], index=["apple", "banana", "cherry"])
#Task:
# ● Add both series
# ● Find the total sales of all fruits combined

import pandas as pd

S1 = pd.Series(
    [10, 20, 30],
    index=["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
)

S2 = pd.Series(
    [5, 15, 25],
    index=["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
)
total = S1 + S2

print("Sales of each fruit:")
print(total)

grand_total = total.sum()

print("Total sales:", grand_total)
