#2. Temperature Monitoring System A weather station records temperatures for two days.
#Scenario: Day 1: [30, 32, 31] Day 2: [29, 33, 34]
#Task:
# ● Create a 2D NumPy array to store this data.
# ● Print the array.
# ● Find the total temperature recorded.

import numpy as np

temperature = np.array([
    [30, 32, 31],
    [29, 33, 34]
])

print("Temperature Array:")
print(temperature)

print("Total Temperature:", np.sum(temperature))
