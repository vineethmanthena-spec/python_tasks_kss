#4. Combine Two Sensor Readings Two sensors record readings during a test.
#Scenario: Sensor1 = [10, 20, 30] Sensor2 = [40, 50, 60]
#Task:
#● Store both readings in NumPy arrays.
#● Combine them into one array using NumPy concatenation.

import numpy as np

sensor1 = np.array([10,20,30])

sensor2 = np.array([40,50,60])

combined = np.concatenate((sensor1, sensor2))
