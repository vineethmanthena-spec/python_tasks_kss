#7. Splitting Data for Parallel Processing A dataset contains the following values:
#[5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30]
#Scenario: You want to distribute the data across 3 processors.
#Task:
# ● Store the data in a NumPy array.
# ● Split it into 3 equal parts using NumPy.

import numpy as np

data = np.array([5,10,15,20,25,30])

parts = np.split(data,3)

print(parts)
