#9. Multi-Department Data Aggregation
#A company collects employee counts from two branches.
#Branch A:
#[[10, 20],
#[30, 40]]
#Branch B:
#[[5, 15],
#[25, 35]]
#Scenario:
# ● Combine the two matrices.
# ● Calculate the total employees across all departments.
# ● Print the combined matrix and total.

branchB = np.array([[5,15],[25,35]])

combined = branchA + branchB

total = np.sum(combined)
