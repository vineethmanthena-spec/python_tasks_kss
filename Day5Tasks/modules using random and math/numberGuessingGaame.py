#Q:Create a Number Guessing Game where: 
#● The program generates a random number between 1 and 50 using random. 
#● The user has 5 attempts to guess the number. 
#● After each guess, calculate the absolute difference using math.fabs() and 
#display how far the guess is from the correct number.
import random
import math

attempts=5
for guess in range(attempts):
    guess=int(input("enter the number:"))
    if guess==secret_number:
        print("you guessed the correct number")
        break
    else:
        difference=math.fabs(secret_number-guess)
        print("wrong guess")
        print("you are",difference,"away from the number")
else:
    print("game over")
    print("the correct number is:",secret_number)
